# DeeperSeek Documentation

A Python library made for interacting with DeepSeek.

# Getting started
Make sure you install [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/) before using this library, as it uses `zendriver` to bypass Cloudflare's anti-bot protection, which requires Chrome/Chromium to be installed. 

# Installation

You can install the library from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/DeeperSeek/) using the following command:

### Normal Operating Systems
```sh
# Windows
pip install DeeperSeek -U

# Linux/macOS
pip3 install DeeperSeek -U
```

### Headless Linux Servers
```sh
# install chromium & X virtual framebuffer
sudo apt install chromium-browser xvfb
pip3 install DeeperSeek -U
```

### Google Collab
```sh
# install dependencies
!apt install chromium-browser xvfb
!pip install -U selenium_profiles DeeperSeek
```
```py
# install chromedriver
from selenium_profiles.utils.installer import install_chromedriver
install_chromedriver()
```

# Initialization

You could initialize the class in two ways, either by using a session token or by using an email and password.

Create an instance of `DeepSeek`:
```py
from DeeperSeek import DeepSeek

api = DeepSeek(
    email = "YOUR_EMAIL",
    password = "YOUR_PASSWORD",
    token = "YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN",
    chat_id = "YOUR_CHAT_ID" # Optional, could be None
    chrome_args = None,
    verbose = False,
    headless = False,
    attempt_cf_bypass = True,
)

await api.initialize() # Necessary to initialize the class, must be called before using other methods
```

# Parameters

- `email (Optional[str])`: The email to use for logging in. Defaults to `None`.
- `password (Optional[str])`: The password to use for logging in. Defaults to `None`.
- `token (Optional[str])`: The `userToken` cookie from https://chat.deepseek.com/. Defaults to `None`. If you don't have, or use a token, you **need** to use the email and password to log in.
- `chat_id (Optional[str])`: The chat ID. Defaults to `None`.
    - To obtain a chat ID, click on any chat, then take the part of the URL that comes after `https://chat.deepseek.com/a/chat/s/`
        - Example: The conversation ID in the URL `https://chat.deepseek.com/a/chat/s/6hs721c22-c4f3-42w22-8788-a39eb21413bb` is `6hs721c22-c4f3-42w22-8788-a39eb21413bb`.
- `verbose (bool)`: Whether to print debug messages or not. Defaults to `False`.
- `headless (bool)`: Whether to run Chrome in headless mode or not. Defaults to `True`.
- `chrome_args: (list)`: The Chrome arguments to use. Defaults to `[]`.
- `attempt_cf_bypass (bool)`: Whether to attempt to bypass Cloudflare protection or not. Defaults to `True`.

# Obtaining the session token

1. Go to https://chat.deepseek.com/ and open the developer tools by clicking `F12`.
2. Head over to `Application` > `Local Storage` > `https://chat.deepseek.com`.
3. Scroll down till you find `userToken`, click on it, a preview will show up beneath it, right click on the line that contains `value` and click `Copy value`.

## DeepSeek Methods

### Remember to initialize the class first!
```py
from DeeperSeek import DeepSeek
api = DeepSeek(...)
```
### Sending a message
```py
response = api.send_message(
    "Hey DeepSeek!",
    deepthink = True, # Whether to use the DeepThink option or not
    search = False, # Whether to use the Search option or not
    slow_mode = True, # Whether to send the message in slow mode or not
    slow_mode_delay = 0.25, # The delay between each character when sending the message in slow mode
    timeout = 60, # The time to wait for the response before timing out
) # Returns a Response object
print(response.text, response.deepthink_duration, response.deepthink_content)
```
### Regenerating the last response
```py
response = api.regenerate_response(
    timeout = 60, # Time to wait for the message to regenerate before timing out.
) # Regenerates the last response sent by DeepSeek. Returns a Response object
print(response.text)
```
### Resetting the conversation
```py
api.reset_chat()
```
### Logging out
```py
api.logout()
```
